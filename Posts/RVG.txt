*“They say I’m evil. They say hurry up, get on with it. You get what you get.”*
Hailing from north Melbourne, RVG (less likely known as Romy Vager Group) self-released their first LP early this year of the same name, “A Quiet Mercy”.  The title track’s hazy guitar and later fanfare is a great introduction to the Aussie group. The sound is punk-ish, syncopated, and builds with the vocals of a death-row narrator who’s crying out for reason in a cynical world: “There’s no evil in me”.
The single has been picked up as a 12” release from Fat Possum Records, out May 25th. Follow RVG on facebook and Bandcamp here:
